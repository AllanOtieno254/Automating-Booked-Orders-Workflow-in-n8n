# Filtering Orders in n8n

## Overview
In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to filter data using conditional logic and expressions in nodes by using the **If node** in n8n. This will ensure that only orders with `orderStatus = processing` are inserted into Airtable, while the rest are summed up separately.

### Workflow Outcome
After this step, your workflow should be able to:
- Filter orders based on their `orderStatus`.
- Insert only **processing** orders into Airtable.
- Sum up the total of all **booked** orders separately.

---

## Steps to Filter Orders

### 1. Remove the Connection to the Airtable Node
Since we only want to insert **processing** orders into Airtable, first remove the direct connection between the **HTTP Request** node and the **Airtable** node:

- Hover over the arrow connecting the **HTTP Request** node and the **Airtable** node.
- Click on the **trash icon** to remove the connection.

### 2. Add and Configure the If Node

Next, add an **If node** to the workflow, which will filter data based on `orderStatus`.

#### Steps:
1. Select the **+** icon next to the **HTTP Request** node.
2. Search for **If node** and select it.
3. In the If node settings, configure the parameters:

   - **Set Value1** to `{{ $json.orderStatus }}`:
     - Hover over the **Value1** field and select the **Expression** tab.
     - Open the **Expression Editor** by clicking on the **link icon**.
     - In the left panel, navigate to `HTTP Request > orderStatus` and drag it into the expression field.
     - Close the Expression Editor.
   
   - **Operation**: Select `String > is equal to`
   - **Set Value2** to `processing`

4. Select **Test Step** to verify the results:
   - Orders with `orderStatus = processing` should appear in the **True Branch output**.
   - Orders with `orderStatus = booked` should appear in the **False Branch output**.

## 3. Insert Data into Airtable
Since we only want to insert **processing** orders into Airtable:

1. **Connect the If node's True Branch to the Airtable node**:
   - Drag the **True connector** from the **If node** to the **Airtable** node.

2. **Test the Airtable node**:
   - Open your table in **Airtable** and delete all existing rows.
   - Open the **Airtable node** in n8n and click **Test Step**.

### Expected Results
- Airtable should now contain only the **processing** orders.
- The number of records in Airtable should now be **14 instead of 30**.

---

## Summary
By implementing the **If node**, we've successfully filtered and inserted only `processing` orders into Airtable. The **booked** orders are handled separately, preventing unnecessary data entries. This ensures efficient data management and cleaner workflows.

Now, your workflow is well-structured and ready for the next step!
