# Notifying the Team

## Overview
In this step of the workflow, you will learn how to send messages to a Discord channel using the Discord node in n8n. This will allow Nathan's team to receive notifications about booked orders directly in their Discord server.

After completing this step, your workflow should resemble the provided reference.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you:
- Have access to the [n8n Discord server](https://discord.gg/n8n) and the `#course-level-1` channel.
- Have your Webhook URL ready from the email received when signing up for this course.

## Adding the Discord Node

1. **Insert a Discord Node**
   - In your workflow, add a **Discord node** connected to the **Code node**.
   - Search for `Discord` in the node search bar.
   - Select `Message Actions` > `Send a Message`.

2. **Configure the Discord Node**
   - **Connection Type:** Select `Webhook`.
   - **Credential for Discord Webhook:** Select `- Create New Credential -`.
   - **Webhook URL:** Copy and paste the Webhook URL from the course email.
   - Click `Save` and close the credentials dialog.

3. **Set Up the Message Content**
   - In the **Discord node window**, configure the parameters:
     - **Operation:** Select `Send a Message`.
     - **Message:**
       - Click the `Expression` tab on the right side of the Message field.
       - Copy and paste the following expression:

     ```
     This week we've {{$json["totalBooked"]}} booked orders with a total value of {{$json["bookedSum"]}}.
     My Unique ID: {{ $('HTTP Request').params["headerParameters"]["parameters"][0]["value"] }}
     ```

4. **Test the Discord Node**
   - Click `Test step` in the Discord node.
   - If successful, the output should be displayed in n8n and a message should be sent to the Discord channel.

## Alternative Communication Apps
Instead of Discord, you can use other communication nodes such as:
- Slack
- Mattermost

These apps can be integrated in a similar way using their respective nodes in n8n.

## Summary
- You have successfully set up a Discord notification system for booked orders.
- This ensures real-time updates for Nathanâ€™s team.
- You can modify this setup for different communication platforms if needed.
