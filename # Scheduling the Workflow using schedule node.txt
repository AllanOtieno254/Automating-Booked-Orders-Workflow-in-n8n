# Scheduling the Workflow

## Overview
This step of the workflow focuses on automating execution by scheduling it to run automatically at a fixed time using the **Schedule Trigger node** in n8n. After completing this step, your workflow will execute automatically every Monday at 9 AM instead of requiring manual execution.

## Steps to Schedule the Workflow

### 1. Remove the Manual Trigger Node
Before scheduling the workflow, you need to remove the existing **Manual Trigger node**:
- Select the **Manual Trigger node** connected to your **HTTP Request node**.
- Click on the **trash can icon** to delete it.
- The "Add first step" option will appear, indicating that the workflow is ready for a new trigger.

### 2. Add the Schedule Trigger Node
Next, add the **Schedule Trigger node** to automate the workflow:
1. Open the **nodes panel** and search for **Schedule Trigger**.
2. Select the node when it appears in the search results.
3. Configure the following parameters:
   - **Trigger Interval:** Select `Weeks`.
   - **Weeks Between Triggers:** Enter `1`.
   - **Trigger on weekdays:** Select `Monday` (remove `Sunday` if added by default).
   - **Trigger at Hour:** Select `9 AM`.
   - **Trigger at Minute:** Enter `0`.

Your **Schedule Trigger node** should now be properly configured to run every Monday at 9 AM.

### 3. Set the Correct Timezone
To ensure the workflow runs at the correct time:
- Verify that the **timezone settings** are correctly configured in your **n8n instance** or the **workflow settings**.
- The **Schedule Trigger node** will use the workflow's timezone if set; otherwise, it will fall back to the n8n instanceâ€™s timezone.

### 4. Connect the Schedule Trigger Node
- Return to the workflow canvas.
- Drag the connection arrow from the **Schedule Trigger node** to the **HTTP Request node**.
- This ensures the workflow starts automatically based on the scheduled time.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, your workflow will now execute **automatically every Monday at 9 AM**, eliminating the need for manual execution. This improves efficiency and ensures the task runs consistently at the desired time.
